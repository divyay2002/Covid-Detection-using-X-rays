Project Overview:
This project aims to detect COVID-19 infection from chest X-ray images using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), along with various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to provide a proof-of-concept model that can assist healthcare professionals by accurately classifying X-ray images into COVID-19 positive and negative categories.

Objectives:
Develop a model capable of identifying COVID-19 infection from chest X-ray images.
Compare the performance of CNN with other machine learning algorithms to evaluate the best approach.
Demonstrate the potential of AI in supporting early diagnosis and decision-making in medical imaging.
Data Source:
The dataset consists of X-ray images collected from publicly available COVID-19 datasets. These datasets include labeled images for both COVID-19 positive and negative cases, allowing the model to learn distinguishing features.

Approach and Methodology:
Data Preprocessing:

Images were resized and normalized to ensure consistency and enhance model performance.
Data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, zoom, and flipping, were applied to increase the dataset's variability and improve model generalization.
Model Development:

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was designed to automatically extract features from the X-ray images and classify them.
Hyperparameter tuning and model optimization were conducted to achieve higher accuracy and robustness.
Various machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, KNN) were also tested as a comparison to the CNN model.
Evaluation:

The model was evaluated using standard performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, to assess its effectiveness in detecting COVID-19 from X-ray images.
Cross-validation was used to ensure the model's robustness and reduce overfitting.
Results:
The CNN model achieved [mention your accuracy, e.g., 95%] accuracy on the test set, showing promising results in detecting COVID-19 from chest X-rays.
Comparisons with other machine learning models showed that CNN outperformed traditional algorithms in image-based COVID-19 detection.
